# 🏡 House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict house sale prices using the **Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset. The goal is to build a robust regression model to accurately estimate the market value of residential properties.

## 📦 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
- Files: `train.csv`, `test.csv`

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for EDA
- Scikit-learn for preprocessing and modeling
- Random Forest Regressor (baseline model)

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. Data Loading
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Building & Evaluation
6. Prediction on Test Set
7. Submission CSV generation

## 📈 Performance Metrics
- R² Score
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

## 📂 Files
- `EDA_and_Modeling.ipynb` – main notebook
- `submission.csv` – model output predictions
- `README.md` – project overview
- `.gitignore` – files excluded from version control

## ✅ Usage
Clone the repo and open the Jupyter notebook to explore, train, or improve the model.

```bash
